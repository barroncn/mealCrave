This crowd-sourced app allows users to put all those food pictures to good use: to help YOU find what will satisfy your next meal craving. Anyone can use the app to search for what they are craving. When the user sees an appitizing picture of just what they want, he or she can click the picture to get more information (price, restaurant, etc) and then by clicking the restaurant name, the user can get driving directions and current approximate drive time from their location to the restaurant where their meal is waiting to be devoured!

This app was created with a team of four developers. I was in charge of the search results page design and function as well as the maps page function. The API calls and parsing the JSON data were part of my job as well.
